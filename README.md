**Your not allowed to change anything in the source unless you own it, removing the alpha license 2.0 would cause bot problems or even worse.**

**Things to do**
Copy it into [replit](https://repl.it) or any other site u want.
U can change the bot support server and invite link, but ur not allowed to change anything copyrighted .e.g **Changing the bot owners id**, else u can do things that are allowed.

Do **not** say your the owner when you aren't.

**Thing your not forced but can do**

A [Sub](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-3B-fE0YywLvgml1q8EBA/) would be amazing.
